    <p>
        Dungeon Draw is just a HTML/CANVAS experiment. It was inspired by <a
            href="https://twitter.com/DysonLogos/status/1258788823263215616" target="_blank">this tweet</a> of Dyson Logos.

        The idea behind was something like: Ok, that video is interesting, I think I can do it easily... and maybe it helps to people to draw easy maps... mmmm ...(thinking) do this, do that,
        ... done!... Oh, fuck: now I have to publish this shit!.

        If you are interested and want to improve it, DO IT. Just go to the <a
            href="https://github.com/spheras/dungeondraw" target="_blank">github site</a>, clone the project, push your
        changes, or whatever... Maybe you want to add more brushes, ... It can be improved a lot (IT WAS JUST AN EXPERIMENT!).
